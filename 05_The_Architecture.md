1. **We use NLP (Natural Language Processing) to interact with the database**  
   - This means you can **ask questions in plain English**, and it will **convert them into SQL queries** automatically.  
   - **Example:**  
     You type: **"Show me the top 5 customers by revenue."**  
     **AI converts this into an SQL query** and runs it in **Oracle Autonomous Database.**  
     You get the answer instantlyâ€”**no need to write SQL manually.**  

2. **We use LLMs (Large Language Models) through SQL**  
   - The database can **talk to an AI model (LLM)** to improve responses, generate SQL queries, or even summarize data.  
   - **Example:**  
     You ask: **"Explain this SQL query."**  
     The AI model **reads the SQL and explains it in simple words.**  
     This helps non-technical users **understand complex queries** without needing a SQL expert.  

### **Final Understanding:**  
**NLP helps you ask database questions in plain English.**  
**LLMs (like ChatGPT) help explain SQL, improve queries, and provide better insights.**  
**Both work together through SQL to boost productivity and make database interaction easy.**
