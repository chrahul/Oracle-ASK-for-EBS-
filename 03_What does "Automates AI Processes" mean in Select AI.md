### **What does "Automates AI Processes" mean in Select AI?**
Think of **Select AI** as a **smart assistant** that handles all the complex AI tasks in the background while you just **ask questions in plain English**. Here's how it works:

1. **Converts User Prompts into SQL**  
   - You type a question like:  
     **"Show me the top 10 customers by revenue this year."**  
   - Instead of writing SQL manually, **Select AI automatically translates this into an SQL query**, runs it, and gives you the answer.

2. **Manages Vector Stores (AI-powered Search)**  
   - It remembers and organizes information in a way that makes AI searches **smarter and more relevant**.  
   - Example: Instead of searching by **exact keywords**, it understands **meaning and intent**, making search results more **accurate and useful**.

3. **Generates Synthetic Data (Fake Data for Testing & AI Training)**  
   - When you need **sample data** for testing AI models or applications, Select AI can create **realistic but fake** data that mimics actual records.  
   - Example: Instead of using real customer data for AI training (which can be sensitive), it **creates synthetic customer data** that looks real but isn't.

4. **Interacts with Large Language Models (LLMs like ChatGPT, Oracle GenAI, etc.)**  
   - Select AI **talks to AI models** behind the scenes to **generate, explain, or improve SQL queries** and **fetch relevant information**.  
   - Example: If you don’t know **what SQL to write**, you can just **describe what you want**, and Select AI will **generate the SQL for you**.

### **In short, Select AI does all the hard work, so you don’t have to:**
**You ask a question in plain English.**  
**It figures out the right SQL query for you.**  
**It searches your database smartly (using AI-powered vector search).**  
**It creates test data when needed.**  
**It talks to AI models to improve responses.**
