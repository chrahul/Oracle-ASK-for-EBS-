### **Oracle Select AI – Key Concepts Explained Simply**  

Select AI helps users interact with databases and AI models **using plain English**, without writing SQL. Below are the key terms and concepts you need to know:  

---

### **1. Actions (What Select AI Can Do)**
These are commands that tell Select AI **how** to process a query.  

- **runsql** – Converts a natural language prompt into SQL, runs it, and returns the result.  
- **showsql** – Shows the generated SQL query without running it.  
- **narrate** – Summarizes query results in simple language.  
- **chat** – Sends a user question to the AI model for a direct response.  
- **explainsql** – Explains what a SQL query does in plain English.  

---

### **2. AI Profile**
A **set of settings** that tells Select AI **which AI provider to use**, how to handle metadata, and how to generate responses.  

---

### **3. AI Provider**
The company that provides the **AI model** that Select AI uses (like Oracle GenAI, OpenAI, etc.).  

---

### **4. Conversations**
Select AI remembers the last **10 interactions** so it can give better answers by using past context.  

---

### **5. Database Credentials**
The **username and password** (or other security methods) needed to access a database.  

---

### **6. Hallucination in LLM**
When an AI **makes up** incorrect or misleading information instead of giving factual responses.  

---

### **7. IAM (Identity and Access Management)**
Controls **who** can access cloud resources and **what** they can do.  

---

### **8. Large Language Model (LLM)**
A **powerful AI model** trained to understand and generate text. Used in Select AI for **chat responses, SQL generation, and explanations**.  

---

### **9. Metadata & Metadata Clone**
- **Metadata** – Information about database structure (tables, columns, views, etc.).  
- **Metadata Clone** – A copy of the **database structure** (without data) for testing or development.  

---

### **10. Natural Language Prompts**
Plain English instructions that guide Select AI to **fetch data, generate SQL, or explain results**.  

---

### **11. Network Access Control List (ACL)**
A security rule that **controls which devices and users can connect** to a database.  

---

### **12. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**
A process where **AI searches for relevant data before generating a response**, making the answers more **accurate and reliable**.  

---

### **13. Semantic Similarity Search**
AI-powered search that **understands meaning**, not just keywords. Helps find relevant information even if words are different.  

---

### **14. Vector Concepts (AI-Powered Search)**
- **Vector Store** – A database that stores AI-generated data representations (vectors).  
- **Vector Index** – A way to organize vectors for **fast searches**.  
- **Vector Distance** – A measurement of how **similar** two pieces of data are.  

---

### **Final Takeaway:**  
Oracle Select AI **removes the need for SQL expertise** by letting users **ask questions in plain English** and get results instantly. It uses **AI-powered search** and **retrieval methods** to make data interaction **faster, smarter, and easier**.  

**No SQL? No Problem!** Just type your question and let AI handle the rest.
