## **Architecture Overview**  

The **NLQ solution for Oracle EBS** integrates **Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB)** with **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Generative AI**, enabling seamless **translation of natural language prompts into SQL queries**. The key components include:  

1. **Ask Oracle E-Business Suite UI** – A user-friendly interface built using **Oracle APEX**, where users enter natural language queries.  
2. **Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB)** – Uses the **Select AI** feature to interpret natural language inputs and generate SQL queries.  
3. **OCI Generative AI Service** – Utilizes **Large Language Models (LLMs)** (e.g., **Cohere, Llama-2**) to convert user queries into structured SQL statements.  
4. **EBS Database** – Executes the generated SQL queries within a **secure schema** while ensuring strict access controls.  

---

## **Security Features**  

The architecture follows **robust security best practices** to ensure **data protection** and **compliance with EBS security configurations**:  

- **Execution in a Dedicated Schema (XX_NLQ)** – Queries run within a restricted schema with minimal privileges.  
- **Virtual Private Database (VPD) Policies** – Ensures role-based access to data, aligning with existing **EBS security setups**.  
- **Secured Views** – Only authorized data is accessible, mitigating unauthorized access risks.  

---

## **Step-by-Step Workflow**  

### **1. User Input**  
- Users submit queries via the **Ask Oracle E-Business Suite UI**.  
- Example: *"Show me all overdue invoices from last month."*  

### **2. Natural Language Processing**  
- The query is sent to **Oracle ADB’s Select AI feature**, where:  
  - **Metadata enrichment** (e.g., table names, column descriptions) enhances the prompt for accuracy.  
  - **LLM hallucinations** are minimized through contextual database insights.  

### **3. SQL Query Generation**  
- The **enhanced prompt** is processed by an **OCI Generative AI model** (such as Cohere or Llama-2).  
- A **SQL query tailored to the EBS schema** is generated.  

### **4. Query Execution**  
- The **SQL query runs inside the EBS database** within the **XX_NLQ schema**.  
- This schema enforces **restricted permissions** for enhanced security.  

### **5. Data Retrieval**  
- The **query fetches data from the EBS database**, ensuring compliance with role-based access.  

### **6. Response Presentation**  
- The **retrieved data is formatted** and displayed on the **Ask Oracle E-Business Suite UI**.  
- Results can be **viewed as tables, summaries, or visual charts**.  

---

## **Key Technical Components**  

### **Oracle APEX**  
- Provides a **low-code UI framework** for the **Ask Oracle EBS interface**.  
- Simplifies user interaction and query submission.  

### **Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB)**  
- Hosts **Select AI**, which converts **natural language prompts into SQL queries**.  
- Enriches prompts with **metadata augmentation** for improved accuracy.  

### **OCI Generative AI**  
- **Processes natural language inputs** to generate optimized SQL queries.  
- Supports **multiple AI models**, including **Cohere** and **Llama-2**.  

### **Security Mechanisms**  
- **Dedicated Schema (XX_NLQ)** ensures **controlled execution** of queries.  
- **Virtual Private Database (VPD)** and **secured views** enforce **EBS security policies**.  

---

## **Deployment Options**  

While **Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB) must run on OCI**, Oracle **EBS can be deployed on-premises or in OCI**, offering **flexibility** based on enterprise requirements.  

---

## **Benefits of ASK for Oracle EBS**  

### **1. Simplified Data Access**  
- Users can query **EBS data using natural language**, eliminating the need for SQL expertise.  

### **2. Increased Productivity**  
- Reduces reliance on IT teams for **report generation**.  
- Provides **instant responses** to business queries.  

### **3. Enhanced Data Security**  
- Ensures **data never leaves the EBS environment**.  
- Aligns with **existing role-based access controls**.  

### **4. Scalable and Cost-Effective**  
- Cloud-based solution supports **large-scale queries efficiently**.  
- **No additional licensing fees**, with a **pay-per-use model**.

## **What is the XX_NLQ Schema in Oracle EBS?**  

The **XX_NLQ schema** is a **custom schema introduced in Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) Release 12.2** as part of the **Natural Language Query (NLQ) architecture**. It ensures **secure and controlled execution of AI-generated SQL queries**, enabling seamless integration between **Oracle Generative AI, Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB), and EBS**.

---

## **Purpose of the XX_NLQ Schema**  

### **1. Security Isolation**  
- Designed with **minimal privileges** to execute **AI-generated queries securely**.  
- Prevents **unauthorized access** to sensitive EBS data.  
- Ensures queries run **in an isolated environment**, preventing unintended database modifications.  

### **2. Compliance with EBS Security Policies**  
- Aligns with **Oracle EBS role-based access control (RBAC)**, ensuring users only access authorized data.  
- Works alongside **Secured Views** and **Virtual Private Database (VPD) policies** to enforce **row-level and column-level security**.  

### **3. Custom Schema Standards**  
- Uses **Oracle's XX_ prefix convention**, indicating it is a **custom schema**.  
- Specifically created to **support Natural Language Query functionality** within EBS.  

---

## **Functionality of the XX_NLQ Schema**  

### **1. Secure Query Execution**  
- SQL queries **generated by Oracle Generative AI** (via **Large Language Models - LLMs**) are executed **within the XX_NLQ schema**.  
- **Least-privilege principles** are enforced to restrict access **only to necessary tables and views**.  

### **2. Integration with Oracle APEX and EBS**  
- The **XX_NLQ schema interacts with Oracle APEX**, which provides the **"Ask Oracle E-Business Suite"** UI.  
- Queries retrieve **only authorized data** from EBS, ensuring strict compliance with security policies.  

### **3. Controlled Data Access**  
- Uses **Secured Views** to **restrict access** to specific tables and columns **based on user roles**.  
- **VPD Policies** dynamically apply filters **at runtime**, ensuring data-level security.

## **Key Characteristics of the XX_NLQ Schema**  

✔ **Minimal Privileges** – Grants only essential permissions, reducing security risks.  
✔ **Custom Implementation** – Follows **Oracle’s best practices** for schema creation in **EBS environments**.  
✔ **Isolated Execution** – Queries **never run with elevated privileges**, ensuring controlled execution.  
✔ **Security-Compliant** – Works with **Oracle security models** like **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), VPD, and Secured Views**.  

---

## **Summary**  
The **XX_NLQ schema** is a **dedicated, secure execution environment** within Oracle **EBS 12.2** that allows **AI-generated SQL queries** to be processed **safely and efficiently**. By **isolating execution, enforcing security policies, and integrating with EBS role-based access controls**, it ensures **enterprise-grade data protection and compliance**.
