## **Enabling Natural Language Query (NLQ) for Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) Release 12.2 Using Oracle Generative AI**  

This document outlines the architecture and functionality of **Natural Language Query (NLQ) for Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) Release 12.2**, leveraging **Oracle Generative AI** and **Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB)**. The solution allows users to interact with EBS data using **natural language**, eliminating the need for complex SQL queries.  

---

## **Architecture Overview**  

The **NLQ solution for Oracle EBS** integrates **Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB)** with **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Generative AI**, enabling seamless **translation of natural language prompts into SQL queries**. The key components include:  

1. **Ask Oracle E-Business Suite UI** – A user-friendly interface built using **Oracle APEX**, where users enter natural language queries.  
2. **Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB)** – Uses the **Select AI** feature to interpret natural language inputs and generate SQL queries.  
3. **OCI Generative AI Service** – Utilizes **Large Language Models (LLMs)** (e.g., **Cohere, Llama-2**) to convert user queries into structured SQL statements.  
4. **EBS Database** – Executes the generated SQL queries within a **secure schema** while ensuring strict access controls.  

---

## **Security Features**  

The architecture follows **robust security best practices** to ensure **data protection** and **compliance with EBS security configurations**:  

- **Execution in a Dedicated Schema (XX_NLQ)** – Queries run within a restricted schema with minimal privileges.  
- **Virtual Private Database (VPD) Policies** – Ensures role-based access to data, aligning with existing **EBS security setups**.  
- **Secured Views** – Only authorized data is accessible, mitigating unauthorized access risks.

## **Step-by-Step Workflow**  

### **1. User Input**  
- Users submit queries via the **Ask Oracle E-Business Suite UI**.  
- Example: *"Show me all overdue invoices from last month."*  

### **2. Natural Language Processing**  
- The query is sent to **Oracle ADB’s Select AI feature**, where:  
  - **Metadata enrichment** (e.g., table names, column descriptions) enhances the prompt for accuracy.  
  - **LLM hallucinations** are minimized through contextual database insights.  

### **3. SQL Query Generation**  
- The **enhanced prompt** is processed by an **OCI Generative AI model** (such as Cohere or Llama-2).  
- A **SQL query tailored to the EBS schema** is generated.  

### **4. Query Execution**  
- The **SQL query runs inside the EBS database** within the **XX_NLQ schema**.  
- This schema enforces **restricted permissions** for enhanced security.  

### **5. Data Retrieval**  
- The **query fetches data from the EBS database**, ensuring compliance with role-based access.  

### **6. Response Presentation**  
- The **retrieved data is formatted** and displayed on the **Ask Oracle E-Business Suite UI**.  
- Results can be **viewed as tables, summaries, or visual charts**.

## **Key Technical Components**  

### **Oracle APEX**  
- Provides a **low-code UI framework** for the **Ask Oracle EBS interface**.  
- Simplifies user interaction and query submission.  

### **Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB)**  
- Hosts **Select AI**, which converts **natural language prompts into SQL queries**.  
- Enriches prompts with **metadata augmentation** for improved accuracy.  

### **OCI Generative AI**  
- **Processes natural language inputs** to generate optimized SQL queries.  
- Supports **multiple AI models**, including **Cohere** and **Llama-2**.  

### **Security Mechanisms**  
- **Dedicated Schema (XX_NLQ)** ensures **controlled execution** of queries.  
- **Virtual Private Database (VPD)** and **secured views** enforce **EBS security policies**.

## **Deployment Options**  

While **Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB) must run on OCI**, Oracle **EBS can be deployed on-premises or in OCI**, offering **flexibility** based on enterprise requirements.  

---

## **Benefits of ASK for Oracle EBS**  

### **1. Simplified Data Access**  
- Users can query **EBS data using natural language**, eliminating the need for SQL expertise.  

### **2. Increased Productivity**  
- Reduces reliance on IT teams for **report generation**.  
- Provides **instant responses** to business queries.  

### **3. Enhanced Data Security**  
- Ensures **data never leaves the EBS environment**.  
- Aligns with **existing role-based access controls**.  

### **4. Scalable and Cost-Effective**  
- Cloud-based solution supports **large-scale queries efficiently**.  
- **No additional licensing fees**, with a **pay-per-use model**.
