### How Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) Works Using Modules and Its Architecture  

Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) is an integrated business application that helps organizations manage their finance, human resources, supply chain, procurement, projects, and more. It operates module-wise, meaning different modules handle different business functions, but they are all connected within the same system.  

---

## How EBS Works Using Its Modules  

### 1. Finance Management (GL, AP, AR, FA, CM)  
This area tracks company money, including income, expenses, payments, and reports.  

Example Process for Accounts Payable and General Ledger:  
1. A company receives an invoice from a supplier.  
2. The Accounts Payable (AP) module records this invoice.  
3. The Cash Management (CM) module checks if funds are available.  
4. The invoice is approved and paid through AP.  
5. The General Ledger (GL) module updates the financial records with this transaction.  

Key Modules Involved:  
- General Ledger (GL) – Tracks all financial transactions.  
- Accounts Payable (AP) – Manages supplier payments.  
- Accounts Receivable (AR) – Tracks customer payments.  
- Cash Management (CM) – Handles cash flow and bank transactions.

### 2. Procurement and Supply Chain (PO, INV, OM, ASCP)  
This area manages buying, inventory, and customer orders.  

Example Process for Procurement and Inventory:  
1. A procurement officer creates a Purchase Order (PO) for raw materials.  
2. The Purchasing (PO) module sends this order to the supplier.  
3. The supplier delivers the materials, which are recorded in the Inventory (INV) module.  
4. The Order Management (OM) module tracks sales orders and the delivery of goods to customers.  
5. If more stock is needed, the Advanced Supply Chain Planning (ASCP) module suggests reordering.  

Key Modules Involved:  
- Purchasing (PO) – Manages buying from suppliers.  
- Inventory (INV) – Tracks stock levels.  
- Order Management (OM) – Manages customer orders.  
- Advanced Supply Chain Planning (ASCP) – Helps plan demand and supply.

### 3. Human Resources and Payroll (HRMS, Payroll, SSHR)  
This area manages employees, salaries, and attendance.  

Example Process for Employee Payroll and Leave Management:  
1. A new employee joins the company and is added to the HRMS module.  
2. The employee submits a leave request through Self-Service HR (SSHR).  
3. The manager approves or rejects the leave request in HRMS.  
4. At the end of the month, the Payroll module calculates salary based on attendance and tax deductions.  

Key Modules Involved:  
- HRMS (Core HR) – Stores employee records.  
- Self-Service HR (SSHR) – Employees apply for leave and update personal details.  
- Payroll – Manages salary payments and deductions.  

---

### 4. Project Management (Projects, Billing, Costing)  
This area handles large projects, costs, and billing.  

Example Process for Project Costing and Billing:  
1. A company wins a construction project and records it in the Projects module.  
2. The project team logs expenses in the Project Costing module.  
3. At the end of the project, an invoice is sent to the customer via the Project Billing module.  
4. Payments received are recorded in Accounts Receivable (AR).  

Key Modules Involved:  
- Project Costing – Tracks project expenses.  
- Project Billing – Manages invoices for project work.

## EBS Architecture: How Everything Connects  
Oracle EBS follows a three-tier architecture, meaning it has three main layers that work together.  

### EBS Three-Tier Architecture  
1. Client Tier – Where users access the system  
2. Application Tier – Where the business logic runs  
3. Database Tier – Where all data is stored  

---

### 1. Client Tier (User Interface)  
Who Uses It?  
- Employees, managers, finance teams, HR, procurement teams.  
- They access EBS via a web browser using Oracle Forms, HTML pages, or Oracle Self-Service.  

How It Works?  
- Users log into EBS through a web interface.  
- They request data or perform tasks such as creating invoices, approving leave, and checking inventory.  

---

### 2. Application Tier (Processing Layer)  
What Happens Here?  
- Contains all the business logic for processing transactions.  
- Handles user requests from the Client Tier and communicates with the Database Tier.  
- Uses Oracle Application Server (OAS) to process data requests.  

Example:  
- A user in HR requests a list of all employees in the IT department.  
- The Application Tier processes this request and fetches data from the Database Tier.  

---

### 3. Database Tier (Data Storage)  
What Happens Here?  
- Stores all EBS data, including finance, HR, supply chain, and project records.  
- Uses Oracle Database to store and manage data securely.  

Example:  
- If an employee applies for leave, this data is stored in the HR database.  
- When Payroll runs salary calculations, it retrieves the leave data from the same database.

**How EBS Modules Interact with Architecture:**  

| Module            | Client Tier (Users Accessing Data) | Application Tier (Processing Business Logic) | Database Tier (Storing Data) |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Finance (GL, AP, AR) | Finance team views reports | Processes invoices and approvals | Stores transactions and payments |
| Procurement (PO, INV) | Procurement team places orders | Validates suppliers and stock | Stores supplier and inventory data |
| HR (HRMS, Payroll) | HR logs in to manage employees | Calculates salaries and leave balances | Stores employee records |
| Project Management | Project managers track costs | Approves budgets and invoices | Stores project costs and billing |

## Key Takeaways  
- EBS is made of multiple business modules, each handling specific business operations.  
- These modules interact through a three-tier architecture (Client Tier to Application Tier to Database Tier).  
- Data flows across different modules, for example, procurement sends data to finance, and HR sends data to payroll.  
- Oracle ASK for EBS can help users interact with some modules using AI and natural language queries.
