 **Q 1: How ASK EBS Works ?**.  

---

### **Corrected Flow of ASK EBS**  

1Ô∏è **User Interaction (Oracle APEX UI ‚Äì Frontend)**  
   - The **user types a question** in **plain English** on the **ASK EBS interface** built using **Oracle APEX**.  
   - Example: *"Show me all unpaid invoices from last month."*  

2Ô∏è **Query Processing in Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB) ‚Äì Select AI**  
   - The **APEX application sends the query to Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB)** running on **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**.  
   - **Select AI in ADB** processes the **natural language query** and **adds metadata** (such as relevant table and column names from EBS).  

3Ô∏è **AI Translation (OCI Generative AI & LLM Integration)**  
   - **ADB sends the enhanced query to an LLM (Cohere, Llama-2, etc.)** hosted in **OCI Generative AI**.  
   - The **LLM converts the natural language query into a valid SQL query** tailored to EBS database structure.  

4Ô∏è **SQL Execution in EBS Database (XX_NLQ Schema & Secured Views)**  
   - The **AI-generated SQL query is sent to the EBS Database**.  
   - The query **runs inside a dedicated, restricted schema called XX_NLQ**, which ensures:  
      **Secure Execution** ‚Äì The query runs with **least privilege access**.  
      **Role-Based Data Access** ‚Äì **Virtual Private Database (VPD)** policies ensure users **only see authorized data**.  

5Ô∏è **Results Displayed in APEX UI**  
   - The **query output is returned to the APEX frontend**.  
   - Users **see the results** in a structured format (tables, summaries, or charts).  

---

### **Final Summary of ASK EBS Architecture**
‚úî **APEX UI** ‚Üí Takes the user input in **plain English**.  
‚úî **ADB Select AI** ‚Üí Processes the **natural language query & enhances metadata**.  
‚úî **OCI Generative AI** ‚Üí Uses **LLMs to convert natural language into SQL**.  
‚úî **EBS Database (XX_NLQ Schema)** ‚Üí Runs **SQL securely within EBS with access controls**.  
‚úî **APEX UI** ‚Üí Displays the **query results** in a user-friendly format.  

---

### **Key Corrections from Your Version**  
**Step 2:** ADB doesn‚Äôt just "store metadata"‚Äîit also enhances the query by adding schema information.  
**Step 3:** The LLM in OCI **converts the NLP query into SQL** (ADB itself does not convert it directly).  
**Step 4:** SQL execution happens inside **XX_NLQ schema in the EBS Database**, which ensures **restricted access**.  

---

### Q2 **Where Do the LLM Models Run for ASK EBS?**  

The **LLM (Large Language Model) for ASK EBS runs inside Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)** as part of the **OCI Generative AI Service**.  

---

## ** LLM Deployment for ASK EBS in OCI**  

1Ô∏è **Oracle Hosts LLMs in OCI Generative AI**  
   - The LLM models (such as **Cohere, Meta‚Äôs Llama-2, and others**) are **natively hosted in OCI**.  
   - Oracle **partners with external AI providers**, but the models are **integrated into OCI‚Äôs secure environment**.  

2Ô∏è **ASK EBS Calls OCI Generative AI for Query Processing**  
   - When a user submits a question in **Oracle APEX**, it is first processed in **Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB)**.  
   - ADB **sends the query to OCI Generative AI** to translate the **natural language prompt into SQL**.  
   - The AI processing happens **inside OCI**, ensuring data security and compliance.  

3Ô∏è **Data Never Leaves Oracle Cloud**  
   - Since the **LLMs run inside OCI**, there is **no external API call to OpenAI, Google, or any third-party cloud provider**.  
   - This **ensures complete data privacy**, aligning with **enterprise security policies**.  

---

### **üîπ Where is the AI Model Hosted in OCI?**  
 The **LLMs are part of OCI Generative AI Service**.  
 They are **trained and optimized** to work within **Oracle Cloud environments**.  
 Oracle **partners with AI vendors** (like Cohere) but **keeps the models within OCI‚Äôs secure infrastructure**.  

---

### ** Does Oracle Train Its Own LLMs for ASK EBS?**  
- No, Oracle **does not train its own large-scale LLMs**.  
- Instead, **it integrates third-party AI models (like Cohere, Llama-2) within OCI**.  
- However, Oracle enhances these models with **database-aware optimizations**, ensuring accurate SQL generation.  

---

### **üîπ Final Answer**  
 The **LLM models for ASK EBS run inside Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**, specifically in the **OCI Generative AI Service**.  
 **Data remains within OCI** and does not go to external AI providers.  
 **AI processing happens in Oracle‚Äôs secure cloud environment**, ensuring full compliance with enterprise security.
